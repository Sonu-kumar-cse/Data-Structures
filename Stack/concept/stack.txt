Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity.
It is a simple data structure allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. 
Every time an element is added, it goes on the top of the stack and the only 
element that can be removed is the element that is at the top of  the stack, 
just like a pile of objects.


----Basic features of stack-----

1. Stack is an ordered list of similar data type
2. Stack is a LIFO (last in first out) structure or we can say FILO(first in last out).
3. push() function is used to insert new elements into the stack and pop() function is used 
   to remove an element from the stack. Both insertion and removal are allowed at only one end of
   stack called Top.
4. Stack is said to be in Overflow state when it is completely full and is said to be in Underflow state 
   if it is completly empty.


-----Application of stack--------

The simplest application of a stack is to reverse a word. You push a given word to stack letter by letter and the pop letter from the stack.

there are other use also like :-
    1. Parsing 
    2. Expression Conversion(Infix to Postfix, Postfix to Prefix etc.)


-----Implementation of stack data structure------

Stack can be easily implemented using an Array or a Linked List. 
Array are quick, but are limited in size and Linked list requires overhead to allocate, link, unlink, and deallocate, but is not limited in size.

Algorithm for PUSH operation-
    1. Check if the stack is full or not .
    2. If the stack is full, then print error of overflow and exit the program.
    3. If the stack is not full then increment the top and add the element.

Algorithm for POP operation-
    1. Check if the stack is empty or not.
    2. If the stack is empty, then print error of underflow and exit the program.
    3. If the stack is not empty, then print the element at the top and decrement the top.
