A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children generally referred as left child.
 Each node contains three components:
    1. Pointer to left subtree
    2. Pointer to right subtree
    3. Data element
 the topmost node in the tree is called the root. An empty tree is represented by NULL pointer.

 A representation of binary tree is shown:
    
    
                          ------------
                          |  | A |   |      <--- root node
                          ------------
                          /          \
                -----------         -----------
                |  | B | X |        |  | C |  |
                -----------         -----------
                /                   /         \

Types of binary trees (Based on structure)

    Rooted binary tree :
        It has a root node and every node has atmost two children.
    
    Full binary tree :
        It is a tree in which every node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children.
        The number of nodes n, in a full binary tree is atleast n=2h-1, and atmost n=2^(h+1) - 1, where h is the height of the tree.
        The number of leaf node l, in a full binary tree is number, L of internal nodes + 1 i.e. l=L+1.

                  /  \
                 6    7

    Perfect binary tree :
        It is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
        A perfect binary tree with l leaves has n=2l-1 nodes.
        In perfect binary tree, l=2h and n=2^(n+1) -1 where, n is number of nodes, h is height of tree and l is number of leaf nodes.

               /  \   /  \
              4    5 6    7
    
    Complete binary tree :
        It is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
        The number of internal nodes in a complete binary tree of n node is floor(n/2).

    Degenerate tree :
        It is a tree in which each parent has only one child node. It behave like a linked list.
